### 'Are there any music genres you want to prioritise / avoid?'
- End user wants to occasionally pick favourite or hated genres, either at registering an account or opening the app for the first time. <br>
### 'Would you want the app to have a download function?'
- Lets focus on the implementation of the online service, as adapting to weather will not be available offline. <br>

### 'Will the app cope with many users using the app at the same time and is account sharing allowed?'
- Yes the app can and ideally the client does want to be able to share the account with famiily, so a family account sharing option can be added.

### 'What if a user wanted to change music based on their own mood rather than what the weather is, would they be allowed to change music?'
 - A user can make a playlist on the songs that they want to play, even if the weather could be opposite the mood of the music that they play. <br>


 ### 'Is all the music available?'
- Yes all music is availble and will have a licence to use if needed 

### “Are you gonna allow users to make their own playlists that play based on the weather?”

- They won't be able to make their own playlist, i want the app to create a playlist for the user containing around 100 songs related to the current weather
