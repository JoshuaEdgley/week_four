### 'Are there any genres you want to prioritise / avoid?'
- End user wants to occasionally pick favourite or hated genres, either at registering an account or opening the app for the first time. <br>
### 'Would you want the app to have a download function?'
- Lets focus on the implementation of the online service, as adapting to weather will not be available offline. <br>

### 'Will the app cope with many users using the app at the same time and is account sharing allowed?'
- Yes the app can and ideally the client does want to be able to share the account with famiily, so a family account sharing option can be added.

### 'Are you gonna allow users to make their own playlists that play based on the weather?'

-They won't be able to make their own playlist, i want the app to create a playlist for the user containing around 100 songs related to the current weather.
